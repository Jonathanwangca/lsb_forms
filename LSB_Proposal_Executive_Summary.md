# LSB Enterprise System - Executive Summary
**Liberty Steel Buildings | Budget Request**

## What We're Building

### RFQ System (Request for Quote) - $8,000
A digital platform to manage all construction project quotes. Staff can fill out a standardized 12-section form covering project details, steel specs, roofing, walls, and more. The system supports **Chinese-English bilingual** input with AI translation, generates professional PDF quotes, and keeps a complete history of all changes. No more lost emails, no more inconsistent formats, no more translation delays.

### Work Order System (WKO) - $4,000
An approval workflow system for work orders. When someone creates a WO, it automatically routes through the required departments (Executive, Accounting, Engineering) for approval. Each department can approve, reject, or request changes. Everything is tracked - who approved what, when, and why. No more chasing signatures, no more lost paperwork.
